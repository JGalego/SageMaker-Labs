# Amazon SageMaker Labs üß†

## Overview

> üöß **Caution:** this project is under construction!

An (open) set of curated labs that demonstrate **every** nook and cranny ‚öôÔ∏è of [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/):

* How it supports **all** stages of the ML pipeline - from data collection and labeling to model deployment... and back ‚ôæÔ∏è
* How it automates the entire workflow - welllll, almost... üëÄ looking at you [Amazon Augmented AI](https://aws.amazon.com/augmented-ai/) - and last but *certainly* not least
* How to optimize everything for cost üí∞

Ready to master the mystic art of moving ML-powered apps to production? üßô

0. [Provision infrastructure](infra/README.md) (*optional*)
1. Open [SageMaker Studio](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio.html)
2. Clone this repository
3. Open [A Tour of SageMaker](sagemaker_tour.ipynb)
4. Enjoy! üòâ

## FAQ

> **Which one is better - SageMaker Studio or Notebook Instances?**

In general, SageMaker Studio is a better option.

Starting a Studio Notebook is faster (5-10x) than launching an instance-based notebook.

Furthermore, Notebook sharing is much easier within SageMaker Studio. 

One caveat though is that Studio Notebooks don't support [`local` mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/pipelines-local-mode.html).

For a deeper dive into the differences between these two options, check out [Machine Learning Environments > SageMaker Studio > Use Studio Notebooks > How Are Amazon SageMaker Studio Notebooks Different from Notebook Instances?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/notebooks-comparison.html).
